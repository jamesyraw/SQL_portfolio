# SQL_portfolio
This repo is a project I have given myself using real world data. The purpose of this project is to clean data, analyze it, and then produce data visualizations and gain meaningful insights.
The data is sourced from AskAManager.org and is available here: https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html
I have also included the raw file for the unclean data.

This repo aims to demonstrate competency with SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python.
