# SQL_portfolio
This repo is a collection of various snippets I've written using SQL. They are all based on the great Lahman Baseball database available here: https://github.com/jknecht/baseball-archive-sqlite
This repo is intended as a portfolio where I can house some ideas and receive feedback on my code.
