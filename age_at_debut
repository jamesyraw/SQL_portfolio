-- This code CONCATs the date of birth and converts it into a date format (all data in the Player library is either TEXT or INTEGER). It also converts the date of a player's MLB debut into a date and subtracts it from the DOB. This data is then pivoted into a table
--grouping player count into 5 year buckets.
